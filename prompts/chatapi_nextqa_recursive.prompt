import math

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class and the VideoSegment class that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- Use the llm_query function to access external information and answer informational questions not concerning the image.
- Try to solve the problem recursively by calling recursive_query!! That is you should first decompose a complicated problem into simpler problems, and then further decompose into basic problems.

class VideoSegment:
    """A Python class containing a set of frames represented as ImagePatch objects, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    video : torch.Tensor
        A tensor of the original video.
    start : int
        An int describing the starting frame in this video segment with respect to the original video.
    end : int
        An int describing the ending frame in this video segment with respect to the original video.
    num_frames->int
        An int containing the number of frames in the video segment.

    Methods

    frame_iterator->Iterator[ImagePatch]
    recursive_query(question: str=None, memory_bank={})
        Returns the answer to a complicated question asked about the video starting from the start_index frame. To answer this question will require further code generation/computation. memory_bank contains some prior information

Don't return long strings like "unknown", "I don't know" "doesn't exist"!!! If such thing happens, you should instead use image_patch.simple_query(query) as the last returning logic.
Now, Only answer with a single function starting def execute_command!
Try to solve the problem recursively

- Only uses the provided APIs!!
- The difference between simple_query and recursive_query is that simple_query directly asks a multi-modal model a question of an image. While recursive_query will call the code-generation function again to solve the question using code.
