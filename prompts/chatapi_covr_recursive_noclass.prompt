import math

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- Only use the provided API
- Make sure the parameters are correct when you call the API
- Try to solve the problem recursively by calling recursive_query!! That is you should first decompose a complicated problem into simpler problems, and then further decompose into basic problems.

class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int
        An int describing the position of the (left/lower/right/upper) border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.

    Methods
    -------
    find(object_name: str)->List[ImagePatch]
        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the
        image matching the object_name.
    exists(object_name: str)->bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object_name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify_property(object: str, property: str)->bool
        Returns True if the property of the object is met, and False otherwise.
    simple_query(question: str=None)->str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. 
    compute_depth()->float
        Returns the median depth of the image crop.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int)->ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.

    # If not found, try to directly query from the first image
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image_list[0])
    return image_patch.simple_query("What is the color of the plate on a tan table?")

Don't return long strings like "unknown", "I don't know" "doesn't exist"!!! If such thing happens, you should instead use image_patch.simple_query(query) as the last returning logic.
Now, Only answer with a single function starting def execute_command!

- Only uses the provided APIs!!
- Make sure to return a short answer!! Like return "car" instead of "the car"/'a car'
- Never return 'unknown'
- Read the examples carefully and determine whether to use recursive or not.
