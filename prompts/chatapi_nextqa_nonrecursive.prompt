import math

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class and the VideoSegment class that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- Use the llm_query function to access external information and answer informational questions not concerning the image.

class VideoSegment:
    """A Python class containing a set of frames represented as ImagePatch objects, as well as relevant information.

    ----------

    Methods
    -------

    return answer
 

Don't return long strings like "unknown", "I don't know" "doesn't exist"!!! If such thing happens, you should instead use image_patch.simple_query(query) as the last returning logic.
Now, Only answer with a single function starting def execute_command!
Remember to always call answer = select_answer(video, memory_bank, query, possible_answers) and finally return answer in the end!

- Only uses the provided APIs!!
